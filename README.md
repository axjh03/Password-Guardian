# Password Manager - Version 1

Welcome to the Password Manager! This is a simple version of a password manager designed to help you securely store and manage your passwords. Please note that this is a basic implementation, and it is recommended not to keep high-security expectations from this version.

## Features
- Store and manage passwords securely.
- Generate strong and random passwords.
- Retrieve passwords when needed.

## Technologies Used
- Python: The programming language used for developing the password manager.
- Pandas: Used for data management and organization.
- Fernet Cryptography: Utilized for encrypting and decrypting passwords securely.
- Exception Handling: Implemented to handle errors and provide a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Password Manager, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
```
git clone https://github.com/axjh03/PasswordManager.git
```
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the password manager script:
```
python main.py
```

## How to Use
Once you have started the Password Manager, you will be presented with a menu of options to choose from. Here is a brief explanation of each option:

1. View Passwords: Displays all stored passwords.
2. Add Password: Allows you to add a new password.
3. Generate Password: Generates a strong and random password.
4. Retrieve Password: Retrieves a password for a specified service or website.

## Security Considerations
Please be aware that this is a basic implementation of a password manager and may not provide the same level of security as professional password management solutions. Here are a few security considerations:

- Keep your master password secure and unique. Do not share it with anyone.
- Avoid storing highly sensitive passwords in this version.
- Regularly update your master password for added security.

## Future Improvements
In future versions, we plan to enhance the Password Manager with the following features:

- Encryption: Implement encryption algorithms to further secure stored passwords.
- User Authentication: Add user authentication to protect access to the password manager.
- Improved User Interface: Create a more user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- Password Strength Analysis: Evaluate the strength of stored passwords and provide suggestions for improvement.

Stay tuned for future updates and releases!
